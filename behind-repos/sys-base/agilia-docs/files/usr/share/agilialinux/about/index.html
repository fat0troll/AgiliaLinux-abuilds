<h3><a name="about">About distro</a></h3>
<h4><a name="wtfagilia">What is AgiliaLinux?</a></h4>
<b>AgiliaLinux</b> is a completely non-commercial Linux distribution being developed by Russian community.<br>
<b>AgiliaLinux</b> was started as a fork of another russian distro - MOPSLinux, which was discontinued in April 2010.<br>
<b>AgiliaLinux</b>, as a fork of MOPSLinux, got it's roots from Slackware Linux, but nowadays it is completely independent from any other distro. In other words, saying «AgiliaLinux is a Slackware-based distribution» is not completely correct.<br>
<b>AgiliaLinux</b> aims to attempt to combine principles of KISS and user-friendly, bleeding-edge and acceptable level of stability. Easy, Simple, Fresh. And, of cource, fast.<br>
Our users are mostly Russian-speaking people, so we provide significant attention to Russian localization quality. But we provide multilingual system.
<h4><a name="currentstate">Current status</a></h4>
<p>At this moment, everything is in very very active development, but, since we are all already using AgiliaLinux as our primary and the only OS in many different tasks and environments, we are trying to always keep it as stable as possible.</p>
<p>It means that <b>it is ready to use in most cases</b>, but it may require attention at some updates. Also, nobody can guarantee that some update would not suddenly break your system completely or eat your cat, altrough we are trying to avoid this situations (by the way, there was none of them - only non-critical breakages).</p>
<p>There is no oficial stable release, but we do release "stable" snapshots. It is done this way just because we are still in progress of implementing everything we want in the base system. Altrough we are trying to make any updates easy and seamless, it is theoretically possible that at some moment you will have to reinstall your system to update next. But we hope this won't happen :)</p>

<h4><a name="minifaq">Very tiny FAQ about AgiliaLinux</a></h4>
<b>Q:</b> When you will release an official stable version?<br>
<b>A:</b> Never. Yes, it's only joke :) Right after we decide that there is nothing left to change in base system, and after some reasonable time spent to tests. No one in galaxy can say exactly when it will happen, but this time is closer and closer… Some people says that it will be in 31th December, 2010, but what can be…<br>
<b>Q:</b> I'm a complete noob in Linux. Should I try AgiliaLinux or should I look for something else?<br>
<b>A:</b> If you want to spend some time and understand how it works, and are not afraid of green 'Matrix' console - yes, you should definitely try it. If you want everything to be configured via nasty GUI control center, here is no one (still), and you can fall into a panic if something will not work as expected.<br>
<b>Q:</b> Do you have a LiveCD?<br>
<b>A:</b> LiveCD planned in future. Today we have LiveDVD, which you will use for installing AgiliaLinux. It contains rich Openbox-session. Try it, and you'll like it :)<br>
<b>Q:</b> What is a primary desktop environment in AgiliaLinux?<br>
<b>A:</b> We provide KDE, GNOME and Openbox as most supported and tested environments, so all of them are primary. In addition, we provide LXDE, XFCE, and Fluxbox setup variants out of the box. There is a plan to support E17 installation. All these environments are ready to use out of the box.<br>

<h3><a name="relnotes">Release notes</a></h3>
<p>157 days we spend before Beta 1, it's not accidentally: we rebuild almost half of our packages, and adds many of new stuff. All remember this summer in Russia, it was very fry, as nuclear, it was a reason of very long interval between Snapshot 4 and Beta 1, and we dedicate this Beta for this summer. So, meet AgiliaLinux 8.0 Beta 1 "Nuclear Summer"!</p>
<h4><a name="important">Most important changes</a></h4>
<ul>
	<li> New GTK+-theme <b>Prudence</b>,which was maded by Klogg on Murrine and Equinox engines, now in default KDE and GNOME.
	<li> <b>KDE</b>: update to latest 4.5.2, with latest features of fresh desktop. Dropped ktheme, old KDE theme, which starts from MOPSLinux, because it's very buggy in new KDE (or KDE is very buggy…). Oxygen is new Qt default theme.
	<li> <b>GNOME</b>: ready to use out-of-the-box. Yeah, sure. Updated to 2.32.0. Now GNOME has it's own settings and apps. Deleted garbage from Openbox-session, which was in Snapshot 4.
	<li> <b>Linux Kernel</b>: updated to 2.6.34.7. 2.6.36 will be soon, guys :)
	<li> <b>X.org-server</b>: hell's update. From 1.7 to 1.9 between 5 month. Now X.org setting stored not in xorg.conf, but in /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/. With this update we remove <b>HAL</b> from GNOME and Openbox.
	<li> <b>mpkg</b>: faster, smarter, stronger! Now mpkg faster than never before, and work for fastering mpkg still in progress!
	<li> Oh, my mind… I forgot all of changes…God…Aix help me…
