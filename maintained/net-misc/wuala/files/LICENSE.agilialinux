Hi

You may bundle Wuala with your distribution (this permission applies
only to agilialinux and without further notice not to any other
distribution). However you must use the official name ('Wuala') and the
official icon. You furthermore have to declare the following copyright
notice (e.g. included in the package as we do for our .deb):

********
Copyright (C) 2011 LaCie AG <info@wuala.com>

License:

All rights reserved

The home page of wuala is at:
http://www.wuala.com

Licensing information and third party code:

General Terms and Conditions:

*********

When creating the package you can decide what you want to include -
Wuala consists of two parts: the starter (~150 KB) and the compilation
(~10 MB). When you install wuala from our Website and choose the
.tar.gz-file, you only get the starter part. The compilation will then
be downloaded on first startup. However if you choose the .deb-file you
get the starter (installed to /usr/bin/ and /usr/lib/) and also a
compilation. If this compilation is not up-to-date, it will be updated
on first start up - so it is not a problem to include a slightly
outdated compilation in a package.
Feel free to have a look at both our tar.gz and .deb to find out how
this works together (the starter script in the .deb is different from
the one in the tar.gz).
In the end, you have to decide by yourself what you want to include in
your package - only the starter or also a compilation.

It is your responsibility to keep the wuala package in your repository
more or less in sync with what we provide on our downloads website.
Slightly outdated versions (of both the starter and the compilation) are
however not a problem.


Regards

Marcel
